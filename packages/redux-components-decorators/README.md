# redux-components-decorators
> This module adds additional functionality to [redux-components](https://github.com/wcjohnson/redux-components/packages/redux-components). Start there if you're new to all this.

Allows the use of decorators (currently, decorators based on the legacy Ecmascript proposal) with `ReduxComponent` classes in order to specify class properties.

In order to take advantage of this module, you will need the `transform-decorators-legacy` Babel plugin in your build chain.
