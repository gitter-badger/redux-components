# redux-components-legacy
Implementation of the `redux-components` 0.3.x API on top of the new 0.4.x infrastructure. Designed as an aid in porting old code that uses the 0.3.x API.

## Usage

Replace `require('redux-components')` with `require('redux-components-legacy')`. The exports and API are the same as 0.3.x.
